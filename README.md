## Assignment01  
All elements are denoted by comments in the code files:  
"assignment01.html", "table001.html"    
## NOTE:  
I have a design drawing for my site, but was unable to  
scan it, because the Library was closed, and I do not own  
a smartphone with which I could take a picture. Will  
update this readme with a drawing by Wed. morning, Jan 17.
